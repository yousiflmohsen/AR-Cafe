# AR-Cafe
An AR Cafe game on Unity with 3D interactable objects -- hopefully I'll implement this into a real cafe i'll own someday -- that's the dream at least ;-)


This is an AR Cafe game with a fully integrated main menu, game screen, return to home, and interactable, 3D, trackable objects! The hope with this
is to change the way we order in cafes. How many times do you get something and you're a little disappointed because it didn't look like how you imagined. 
With this, you can scan an item onto your table & see just exactly how an item looks before ordering. I've always wanted to own a cafe and this is just
a mini-passion project that I created to remind me of how I'd want my cafe to work ;-)

There are a LOT of files with this using unity assets from the free asset store, and thus downloading may be a pain -- so please contact me if you have any
issues and we can work through them :-) I also have a video demo if you're just curious haha.
